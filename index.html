	<p>Promethis and Athinaz, of number seven, Chislet Drive, were always ready to say that they were perfectly normal. My family used to speak of them as introverted people who avoided sunlight like vampires would, but I only knew them as the unfamiliar uncle and aunt who always sent letters but never showed up to family reunions during the holidays. Honestly, I would have never guessed that they would be the ones to offer to house me after my emancipation. Who would have thought - I was so stupid, I should have sought out the wellness center - one day, you tell your parents you’re pregnant, and the next, they change the locks. As the tube pulled up to the station, I took off my headphones - the last lines of “American Pie” whispered out the earpieces. 
“This is St. James station, the next stop is Westminster,” echoed the monotonous voice.
No use sullying in the past, I suppose. I heaved my canvas duffel off the seat besides me. Twelve dollars, a used metro ticket, and five days worth of clothing was all I had - rather all they let me have. The door supported a golden seven about the size of my palm. The doorknob shined resiliently, almost as if it had be freshly lacquered. I rang the bell once, twice, then trice … I heard the pitter patter of footsteps approach from behind the door. 
Athinaz cried, “who is it?” After my wispy reply, the pitter patter transformed into loud thuds. The several locks and deadbolts clicked open. The door skidded open, and a beautiful woman sashayed outward. She wore a casual summer dress with a classic bonnet. I tasted a funny salt in the air, a wet kind of salty. It wasn’t until the moment I saw her, so similar to my very own mother, did I realize the circumstances of my situation. I was never able to really conceal my emotions. Athinaz, noticing my utter sadness, asked, “Would you like a hot bath and some snacks? How does that sound, dear?” 
Without an answer, she turned around and started back down the narrow corridor. When she noticed my reluctance, she retraced her steps and held the door open. She assured her “warm welcome” by softly nudging my shoulder blade forward. The hallway was brightly lit with a strong fluorescent glow. We transcended through, walking for what seemed like hours. Suddenly, the pitter patter returned. The noise, much louder than before, engulfed my senses. But before I could ask about the source of the sound, we approached a wall painted in black. 
Nervous, I joked, “was straight the wrong way to go?” 
She answered without hesitation, “Appearances are irrelevant, my child,” as Athinaz walked through the wall. My brain was lost in translation. The wall swallowed her as a pool of water engulfs an olympic diver. I stared at the obsidian wall . . . lost in disbelief. Suddenly, a beige arm reached out, grasped at my lapel, and yanked me forward into darkness.
The transition felt like a blink of the eye, and suddenly I was embraced by a warm glow amidst tungsten light bulbs and candle-lit chandeliers. The pitter patter was no longer just a sound, but rather, animate clay figurines. Each one cleverly crafted, their joints and appendages proportionate to their bodies. Like marionettes without the strings, these clay figurines were robotic but had thoughts of their own. The size of a toddler, these agile creations numbered in the hundreds and assisted Athinaz and Promethis in their daily chores. From sweeping the floor to washing dishes, the clay figurines seemed essentially intertwined in their daily rituals. After Athinaz showed me around the house, we stopped at a kempt, inviting room - my room. The scenery was much different than what I was used to. My experience in a small loft in downtown London compared this “mansion” was a rather stark contrast, but one that I was quite happy with. Athinaz said her goodbyes from the other room. I laid in bed, but as much as my body wanted a deep sleep, my mind ravaged from thought to thought. 
Do I run away? Where would I even run to? What do they want with me? I wish my parents would just take me back. I wish I never told them. What can I even do past this point? 
I woke up, engulfed in the sun’s brilliant warmth. The red letters blared 7:58 AM … even with everything that’s happened, my mind decided against sleeping in late. I took a much needed shower, and realized that my duffel bag had been completely emptied out. A floral dress and a pair of slippers rested at the foot of my freshly-made bed.  
“How nice of her,” I casually blurted.
Athinaz must have stepped in and restored my room to its state as I showered. As I began to dry off, I noticed the pitter patter crescendo from outside the door. The red letters blared 8:30 AM. The door swung open and in came a dozen of these clay figurines. As I scrambled to cover my body with the towel, I let out a hefty screech. But the clay figurines seemed all too preoccupied with their general tasks to pay attention to the nude me that stood before them. Athinaz bursted through the doorway frantically apologizing, and spouting nonsense about how they haven’t been “taught to adjust” to a new roommate. She spoke softly, “E pluribus unum.” Suddenly, the clay figurines began to sprint back out of the room and ran down the hall. Athinaz blushed heavily and apologized, once again, for the intrusion. She quickly rushed out the door in order to avoid sight of my nudity, but not before informing me that breakfast was indeed ready. I sat down on the edge of the bed, and felt as hot as I had in the shower. I scratched at my skin in some sad attempt to either wake myself up from this nightmare or peel off the pain. Eventually my hunger overtook my sadness, and I mustered enough courage to stand.
I was escorted by one of the clay figurines from my bedroom to the dining hall. I noticed infront of a grand staircase was painting frame as lavish as the staircase it was meant to complement. Breakfast was astonishing. With heaping piles of bacon, eggs of all variants, pancakes, frittatas, and waffles galore, I found my appetite growing with each second. But there was an odd atmosphere that lingered around the dining hall. Something I’ve wondered since I walked past the golden seven.
“Where’s Promethis?” I inquired.
“Busy,” Athinaz snapped back with a cold voice.
After breakfast, I ventured around the rooms and decided to explore my new home. I looked at pictures, paintings, and souvenirs from their times together. Athinaz was beautiful, beyond belief, and so charming, too. Yet, in every photo, Promethis was either facing away from the camera or missing entirely. I walked back towards my room and saw the painting frame in its entirety. The frame golden, ornamented, and gilded; yet, completely hollow. Holding nothing of importance, the frame stood as a piece of art in and of itself. There was a handprint on the lower right corner of the master frame.
“Odd … E Pluribus Unum,” I read out the etching on the frame.
I slowly place my hand on the print, and saw as my hand phased through the wall. The wall swallowed me as a pool of water engulfs an olympic diver. The transition felt like a blink of the eye, and suddenly I was eclipsed in dimly lit torches interrupted by darkness. 
The shadows leaped from one corner of the room to the other, bouncing between the soft glow of the moonlight through the glass dome and the eclipse of the rotunda walls. The silhouettes bobbed up and down in their very own magical rendition of the waltz. In the far end of the room, I saw an ugly creature, whose body was covered in spiky and dark-colored hair, spinning clay masterfully. His hair was an oily combination of swirls and streaks. Neatly combed in some spots, while poofy, like bed-head after a good night’s sleep, in other places, his fur mimicked the outline of a craggy mountain range. I watched as he transformed a blob of clay into a child-size figurine. Then, he suddenly breathed life into the figurine. The figurine sprung to life and ran past me and into the wall I had entered from. The creature, watching his creation leave him, saw that I had been standing in the room. He eyed me with a sharp glare, enough to tear the space that had divided us. His glare promoted a dead and deepening silence - until . . . 
“Promethis?” I unconsciously blurted out.
He immediately started to sprint in my direction. I had no idea what he wanted with me. All I knew was that he was a character ripped straight out of a book, he was a “hairy potter.”</p>
